This repo tests whether or not mounting a socket with fig works as expected.

First you should build the image with:

  fig build

Second you can test the image with:

  ./run.sh

Which will execute the image via:

  docker run -i -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock figtest_sockettest


This will contact the volume mounted docker socket from the host and curl the 
containers endpoint. This will cause the host's containers to be displayed.

Now you can try the same thing with fig:

    fig up


You can see that fig does not get a proper mounting of the socket
